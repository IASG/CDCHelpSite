# What is Windows?

Windows is an operating system built by Microsoft with quite a few quirks. There are two main editions, desktop and server, with the desktop one being what most people have used. Server, on the other hand, is quite expensive and hard to get experience with outside of the industry. For the CDC, Windows server will be the most common, but there may be a few desktop or even embedded versions of Windows.

For linux users, it may be strange to use the gui for advanced configurations instead of just opening up a CLI. While there are quite a few very useful CLI tools covered here, and everything can technically be done in the CLI, it is highly recommended to stick to the GUI for most everything.
