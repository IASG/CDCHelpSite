> There is a pretty strict password requirement of 1 upper and lowercase letter, 1 symbol, must be at least 10 characters, and must not contain your username or full name. It is recommenced to use a randomly generated password from a password manager.

The first step in creating an account is going to [signup.iseage.org](https://signup.iseage.org), there is blue button called Register Blue that you want to click to start the registration process. Please note that a valid email address is a needed, since it is used to verify accounts, while a proper name is likely not required.

After clicking the register button you will get an email from ISEAGE to complete account registration.
